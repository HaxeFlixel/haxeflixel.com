## About

This is the source of [haxeflixel.com](https://haxeflixel.com/). It was orgiginally made with [DocPad](https://docpad.bevry.me/), but it's in a transition to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

You can compile this website yourself with an install of DocPad, pull requests are welcome.

1. [Install DocPad](https://docpad.bevry.me/start/install)

2. Clone and run the server

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com.git
   cd haxeflixel.com
   ```

   To install dependencies and build the site, run the following commands:

   ```batch
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

   The website uses [docpad-plugin-thumbnails](https://github.com/rantecki/docpad-plugin-thumbnails)

   - This requires [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) or [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/)
     installed.

3. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

<!-- 4. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory, the live reload plugin will compile the site as you save
the files you modify. -->

### How to add Documentation

Documentation is pulled automatically from the [flixel-docs](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-docs) repository,
please review the readme there for more info on updating the haxeflixel.com/documentation pages.

### How to add a demo

1.  Create a `.md` file in
    [`/11ty-source/demos`](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/tree/deev/11ty-source/demos)
    following this example:

        ```
            ---
            title: "Demo-Name"
            layout: demo
            width: 800
            height: 500
            source: "flixel-demos-subdirectory/Demo-Name"
            ---
            Here goes the actual description of the demo in  GitHub-Flavored-Markdown:
            * What the demo displays
            * Who created it
            * What the controls are
            * etc

            HTML is still allowed and can be used for more advanced descriptions.

        ```

    `source` points to the subdirectory of [flixel-demos](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos)
    that contains the demo.

`width` and `height` default to 640 and 480 and should be omitted in that case.

2. Add a screenshot of the demo named `Demo-Name.png` to
   [`/src/files/demos/images`](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/tree/master/src/files/demos/images).

### How to add a Showcase game

1. Create a `.md` file in
   [`/11ty-source/showcase`](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/tree/dev/11ty-source/showcase)
   following this example:

```
    ---
    layout: showcase
    title: "Go! Go! PogoGirl"
    itch: https://ohsat-andrej.itch.io/go-go-pogogirl
    website: https://www.ohsat.com/game/go-go-pogogirl/
    steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681010/Go_Go_PogoGirl/
    switch: https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/go-go-pogogirl-switch/
    ps4: https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0891-PPSA10169_00-GOGOPOGOGIRLRATG
    xbox: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productid/9P10H7L6QCCJ
    date: "2022-02-01"
    ---

    Dates should use YYYY-MM-DD

    Note that by adding a URL to one of the supported targets, the icon will automatically become coloured on the
    [showcase page](https://haxeflixel.com/showcase) and link to that URL.
```

2. Add a screenshot of the showcase using the same title used in the `*.md` file, e.g. `Go! Go! PogoGirl.png`
   to [`/src/files/images/showcase`](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/haxeflixel.com/tree/master/src/files/images/showcase).
   They are resized and cropped to 500x260, so it's best to use the same ratio.

Showcases that are not officially released yet are only accepted in special cases. The same is true for games from game jams.
