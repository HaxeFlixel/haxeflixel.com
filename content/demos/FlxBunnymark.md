This is a HaxeFlixel port of the BunnyMark Benchmark.

The initial BunnyMark was [created by Iain Lobb](http://blog.iainlobb.com/2010/11/display-list-vs-blitting-results.html) (code) and [Amanda Lobb](http://amandalobb.com/) (art), then ported to haxe-NME by [Joshua Granick](http://www.joshuagranick.com/blog/?p=508), then enhanced by [Philippe Elsass](https://github.com/elsassph/nme-bunnymark.), now ported to HaxeFlixel by [BeebleRox](https://github.com/Beeblerox), and improved by [impaler ](https://github.com/impaler)and [Gama11](https://github.com/Gama11).

Flash is limited to software rendering so there is a significant performance improvement when you use cpp targets. Cpp targets make use of drawTiles() GPU Acceleration and on a desktop it can display 10 000's of bunnies with additional variations of alpha and scaling. On the flash target however, rendering with alpha and scaling means a severe performance decrease.
