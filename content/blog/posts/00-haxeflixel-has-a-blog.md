The HaxeFlixel project and it's active community of game dev enthusiasts, have opened this 
blog up to post about the latest updates, news and anything awesome happening related to
making games with HaxeFlixel and the projects around it.

Although most of the HaxeFlixel activity happens on Github, Slack chat (ask for an invite)
and the @haxeflixel twitter and our google groups, this is resource can help keep users 
up to date on the most important updates and changes to the codebase and community.

Like everything HaxeFlixel, this blog is open for contributions from github by editing the 
markdown files, just like our [documentation](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-docs).

Feel free to fork and improve these blog posts and the website itself.

So if you have ideas or requests shoot them at us ;)
