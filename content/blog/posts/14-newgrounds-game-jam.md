Newgrounds is hosting a HaxeFlixel game jam with a $1,300 prize pool! The theme is "Alone, Together" and submissions have to be uploaded to Newgrounds by Monday, April 27th with the tag "HaxeFlixelJam" included. For more information, check out [their official announcement](https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1450269/1).

We also modernized our [Tutorial](/documentation/tutorial/) to use Ogmo 3, Visual Studio Code and HTML5, so it's a great time to learn HaxeFlixel if you're new to it! If you get stuck, just [hop onto our Discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/rqEBAgF).

Let's make some amazing games!
