As the name would imply, this is a minimalist tower defense game. This was originally created by [Gama11](https://github.com/Gama11) for [Ludum Dare 26](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=16160).  You can find the original source code for that [here](https://github.com/Gama11/LudumDare26).

This was ported to the latest version of HaxeFlixel and OpenFL by [Steve Richey](https://github.com/steverichey/).
