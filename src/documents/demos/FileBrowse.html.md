Demonstrates how to use file browsing on both Flash and Native (CPP/Neko) targets. The Flash target uses FileReference.browse(), while the Native target uses the systools.Dialogs.openFile(). The Native targets depend on the systools library, available on haxelibs.

Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, or the number keys to use a specific zoom level (1-5).
