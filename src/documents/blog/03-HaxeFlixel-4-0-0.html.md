We are proud to announce the release of HaxeFlixel 4.0.0! This is without a doubt the biggest release yet, with nearly 2000 new commits on the core repository alone since the last release.

The highlights of this release are:

* an improved API structure
* a refactored rendering system
* a much improved gamepad API
* improved HTML5 support
* improved OpenFL Next compatibility
* an improved debugger console (now using hscript) with auto-completion
* over 20 new demos
* ...and much more

For a more in-depth breakdown of the changes, have a look at our [changelog](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). If you are mostly interested in the breaking changes to upgrade a project using HaxeFlixel 3.3.x, please refer to the [upgrade guide](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/upgrade-guide-4-0-0/).

We would like to thank all contributors who helped with this release in any way, as well as [our Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=94916&ty=p). Check out the [Financial Summary 06/15 - 02/16](https://www.patreon.com/posts/4421829) blog post on Patreon if you're wondering what we do with your donations.

Going forward, there are two things we want to foucs on:
	
* **A stable API** - Breaking changes should be the exception and only happen in major releases. This also means following [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) more closely.
* **More frequent releases** - 4.0.0 took longer than it should have. We aim to have smaller releases in the future, but release more frequently.
