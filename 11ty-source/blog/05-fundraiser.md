HaxeFlixel is developed by and is now furtherly *funded* by, a community of 
people who have a geniune passion for the project.


We thank everyone for their contributions over the past 5 years, 
whether it has been spreading the word, fundraising, admin, testing,
reviewing & submitting code or teaching and supporting others.
All this keeps inspiring the community to continue HaxeFlixel to help
make cross platform games easier and free!

Also, none of this fundraiser would have even started without the dedicated effort from
Lars Doucet of [Level Up Labs](https://www.leveluplabs.com/)
leading this entire campaign, so a big thanks to Lars!

With the larger donations made in the campaign, it has also made it possible for HaxeFlixel to have
*official sponsors*! After we gather all the logos for the page, we will add a dedicated sponsors page.

[our Indiegogo page](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/haxeflixel-games-software).
