Flash includes a simple way to save data locally, and the FlxSave object allows you to interface with it. This system is not ideal for all things; for example, if you are doing online high scores, this won't really work. If you want players to be able to move and trade save game files, this isn't a good fit either. However, for fast and simple saving of local data, especially things like unlocked progress or user preferences, FlxSave is an easy and built-in option.
