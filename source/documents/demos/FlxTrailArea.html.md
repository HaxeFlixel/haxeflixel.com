This demo shows the effects that can be accomplished with [`FlxTrailArea`](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/blob/dev/flixel/effects/FlxTrailArea.hx). 
For every `FlxSprite` that is added to the area, a trail effect will be rendered on the area. It's more efficient than a regular `FlxTrail` due to the fact that it only uses a single bitmap.
